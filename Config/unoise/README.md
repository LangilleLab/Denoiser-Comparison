### About
This folder contains all config files used to run the UsearchPipe.sh (used for paired reads) and UsearchPipeF.sh (used for single forward reads) scripts. Each File is named by the sample set that the config file corresponds with.

### Config File Setup

Each new line in the config file is taken in as a variable in the order that it is seen (i.e line 1 = variable $0).

Line 1: When set to 1 will delete all previous data generated by this script using this config file

Line 2: The directory that contains the folder that contains the filtered reads.

Line 3: Legacy variable no longer used

Line 4: The max amount of threads to run.

Line 5: Name of the Samples (This can be left blank if u fill in the study name in line 8)

Line 6: Legacy variable (replaced by using different pipeline scripts for forward and paired reads)

Line 8: Set to the study name and will automatically determine the sample names from the fastq input file names.
