### About
This folder contains all config files used to run the DeblurPipeF.sh (forward reads only) and DeblurPipeP.sh (paired reads by running run_pear.pl before running deblur workflow) scripts. Each File is named by the sample set that the config file corresponds with.


### Config File Setup

Each new line in the config file is taken in as a variable in the DeblurPipeF.sh or DeblurPipeP.sh script in the order that it is seen (i.e line 1 = variable $0).

Line 1: When set to 1 will delete all previous data generated by this script using this config file.

Line 2: The directory that contains the folder that contains the filtered reads.

Line 3: The length of the forward reads

Line 4: The length of the reverse reads

Line 5: The max amount of threads to use.

Line 6: Legacy variable replaced by running either DeblurPipeF.sh for single reads only and DeblurPipeP for paired reads.
